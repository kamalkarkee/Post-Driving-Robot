# Post-Driving-Robot
Positioning Partners has created an Unmanned GroundVehicle(UGV) called Positron.The Positron "PostDriving" Rover is a robotic solution to survey marking GPS locations, and then assist in placing markers in the ground. This solution would be particularly helpful on construction sites, where locating precise points and driving rebar into the ground can be very tedious. The rover maneuvers autonomously to given GPS coordinates or it can be controlled manually.
